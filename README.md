As part of my course CS 447, so far I have implemented 

1. smoothed n-gram models 
2. Finite state transducers (FST) - which transduces the infinitive form of verbs to their correct -ing form.
3. Hidden Markov Model using the Viterbi Algorithm.
4. Evaluating PMI (Pointwise Mutual Information)
5. Calculating Token & Sentence Accuracy, Precision and Recall.
